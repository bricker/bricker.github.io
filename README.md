## BryanRicker.com

This is the website code for [bryanricker.com](http://bryanricker.com).

Some time in May of 2013, I decided that trying to maintain a personal website with a blog and a bunch of examples of work was something that I just didn't want to do. I keep my Soundcloud and GitHub repos fairly up-to-date, and I never (ever) blog about anything.

So, I stripped the website down to a single page with just a few links to more interesting stuff. If you're interested in seeing what this website used to be (a full Rails app with a CMS and everything), check out the [v1 branch of this repository](https://github.com/bricker/bryanricker/tree/v1).
